This is a defunct website idea that I had been working. The idea was that students could share questions with each other and work on them together, for example to work out answers to a previous year's exam questions for the purpose of using them to study. Students could also import notes from other similar courses at other institutions.

However the more I thought about it, and the more I talked to people about the idea, the more I realised how problematic this could be, for exmaple if a university is protective of the exam questions of previous years. I wouldn't have enough time to monitor potential intellectual property being uploaded.

I will leave what I have done here for reference in case I want to work on a similar site again.
